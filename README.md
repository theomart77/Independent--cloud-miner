## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/theomart77/Independent--cloud-miner.git
   cd Independent--cloud-miner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your miner**
   - Set your miner address and network settings in the config or as environment variables.
   - Example:
     ```js
     minerAddress: '0xYourEthereumAddress',
     nodeRpc: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY',
     ```

4. **Run the miner**
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

5. **Monitor & manage**
   - Access the dashboard: [http://localhost:8545/dashboard](http://localhost:8545/dashboard)
   - Use the REST API to check rewards, history, and trigger payouts.

## Reward Distribution API

- `GET /rewards/pending` — See pending rewards and payout readiness.
- `GET /rewards/history` — View reward payout history.
- `POST /rewards/payout` — Trigger payout if minimum threshold is reached.
